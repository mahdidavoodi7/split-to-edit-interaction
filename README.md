# ⏱️ Split to Edit Interaction

A smooth, animated time editor built with:

- [Expo](https://expo.dev)
- [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated)

This project showcases a split to edit UI where the time fields expand, round out, and become editable through a clean animated transition — all powered on the UI thread for a snappy native feel.
